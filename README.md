Solution for a randomly generated knapsack problem using a basic genetic algorithm.
When using a local search operator the algorithm is able to beat the greedy heuristic. 
In the project there is also a second file called knapsack_JIT.py, this is a work in progress but is an alternative solution that uses numba to just-in-time compile certain operations to speed up the code.
